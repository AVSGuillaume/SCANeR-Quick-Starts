# Guide 2. How to generate known and unknown test cases?

For Massive Simulation application you will need a list of scenarios to test and validate your systems under test in known and unknow situations.  
Thanks to SCANeR studio you can prepare template scenario with parameters, criteria of success, failures and so on.  
These will enable you to automatically generate known and unknown scenarios and measure their performance.  

In this guide you‚Äôll see how to
- Step 1.	Define template scenario‚Äôs parameters and criteria
- Step 2.	Design a test plan to vary parameters and generate N scenarios

This guide assumes you‚Äôre familiar with SCANeR scenario basis.  
:leftwards_arrow_with_hook: [Create a scenario based on your road network](../HT_Create_your_first_test_case/HT_Create_your_first_test_case.md)

## Step 1. Define template scenario‚Äôs parameters and criteria

> * A **parameter** can change in order to create *variability* when generating several versions of a same template scenario.
> * A **criteria** is a *test* during the simulation to know afterwards what scenario variation succeeded or failed.

When creating a scenario for Massive Simulation it is necessary to make it versatile.  
To do so we will use script variables. A variable can be Input, Output or Internal  
In Step 2 we will vary 2 scenario‚Äôs parameters: `distanceToCollision` and `rainLevel` 

For this reason, we will more focus on those during this Step.  
Regarding criteria, it is mandatory to use Output variables.  
An Output variable makes its content accessible to setup a criteria (e.g. if this Output variable is equal to 1 then it is a success, otherwise it is a failure).
> `Script Output` > `Scenario Result` > `Scenario Criteria`

In the delivered template scenario `EVAL_ADAS_CTRL.sce`, we provide:
* 3 Internal variables (`distanceToCollision`, `rainLevel` and `startToBrake`)
* 2 Output variables (`brakingDistance` and `isCollision`)

Regarding scenario parameters we are all set.  
We‚Äôll make those vary within the Step 2.  
To finish the Step 1 let‚Äôs see how to setup the criteria!  
First Add a result  

![](./assets/AddResults.png)

Select the Output variable you would like to use for your criteria and give it a name.  
In our case we select the Output variable `brakingDistance` and name its result `brakingDistance` (great inspiration üòÖ).

![](./assets/LinkEdition.png)

Repeat this step as many times you need.  
In our case we‚Äôve defined 2 results: `brakingDistance` and `isCollision`  
Now let‚Äôs see how to design or criteria from these results ü§î  
Add a new criterion

Once created, edit it by double clicking on it and set its levels  

![](./assets/EditCriterion.png)

Repeat this step as many times you need.  
In our case we‚Äôve defined 2 criteria: `Braking distance` and `Collision`  

## Step 2. Design a test plan to vary parameters and generate X scenarios

To do so we‚Äôll have to use SCANeR explore.  
It exists different way to move from studio to explore, here is my favorite: from studio click on menu `TOOLS` and select `SCANeRexplore ‚Äì test purpose tool`.  
SCANeR explore opens. 

In this step we‚Äôll see how to design a basic test plan to make vary our scenario parameters and generate known and unknown scenarios.  

1. Create a new test plan: go to menu `FILE\New‚Ä¶` and select `Empty Test Plan`
![](./assets/NewTesPlan.png)

2. Give a name to your test plan and select your SCANeR workspace (configuration: `SAMPLE_COMPUTE_LOCAL` in our case)
![](./assets/NewTesPlan2.png)

3. Now that the test plan is created let‚Äôs create an `Exploration` (a test plan may have several Exporations): Select the SCANeR workspace you want, `SAMPLE_COMPUTE_LOCAL` in our case and the desired scenario, `EVAL_ADAS_CTRL.sce` in our case. You‚Äôll have an overview of the scenario content and its available Output variables. You can add/edit as many parameters, constraints, etc. you want, once ready let‚Äôs Design the Experiment!

> Tips, Output variables are automatically defined to vary, nevertheless, if you would like to add another variable to the list of variation you can do it üòâ

![](./assets/ScenarioSelection.png)
![](./assets/NewExploration.png)

In our case we use

![](./assets/Parameters.png)

4. Select Design of Experiments and click on Add Design of Experiments. From the Definition you‚Äôll be able to set up the type of experiment.

> Tips,
> * Full Factorial: operates a cartesian product between parameter values to generate draws.
> * Statistical: operates a statistical law to the parameter values to generate draws.
> * CSV: imports Draws.

In our case we use

![](./assets/DoE.png)

This set up leads us to generate 60 scenarios. 
Once ready, click on Generate to preview the scenarios.  
You‚Äôll pre-visualize the 60 scenarios that you‚Äôll be able to generate (or not).  

> Tips, at this step the scenarios are not ‚Äúphysically‚Äù generated, you can: decide by selecting/deselecting some to generate these or not; change their name, etc.

In our case we use

5. Once satisfied simply click on `Generate Scenarios`. The scenario files will be produced, you‚Äôll be invited to select a repository to host those.

Congratulations! You now have your known and unknown scenarios to test and validate your systems under test.  
We now have to run these! How to? 3 methods:
* On a local machine, as a parametric exploration, from explore GUI, click on `Execute selected test cases`. This action will call SCANeR compute, scenarios will be executed in sequence.
* On a simulator, using SCANeR studio, all the produced scenarios are compatible with it. Nevertheless, such process is usually used to test and validate systems Massively, so we would prefer to use SCANeR compute.
* On HPC/Cloud, SCANeR compute! Here is the one we were looking for and we‚Äôll detail it into the next guide. SCANeR compute is SCANeR studio solver, it enables to run SCANeR simulation on HPC architecture. You‚Äôll be able to handle it within your favorite IT architecture. It is compatible with any HPC platform (e.g. Azure, AWS, Alibaba) and supports any container solutions (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes). You‚Äôll be able to run it in parallel for Massive Simulation application, design your job scheduling, etc.
