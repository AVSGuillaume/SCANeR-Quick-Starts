# How to run a simulation?

SCANeR graphical seems easy to use? 🤔
You're right! Nevertheless, lets *slow and steady wins the race*.
Here we'll try to give you some good practices 😉

This guide explains how to manage the execution of your simulation
- Step 1. Run modules
- Step 2. Run the simulation
- Step 3. Stop the simulation
- Step 4. Stop modules 

## Step 1. Run modules

1. Click on the `Start Simulator` button (double blue triangles) to launch all the previously selected modules.

2. Verify the status of the modules thanks to symbol in the green circle next to the modules.  
![](./assets/ModuleStates.png)  
The correct status of the module should be `Loaded`  

>All selected modules will automatically start (some of these have GUI, as ACQUISITION, VISUAL, etc.)

## Step 2. Run the simulation
Click on the `Play Scenario` button (black triangle in a green circle) to launch the simulation

The correct status of the module should be `Running`  

>When you run a scenario for the first time SCANeR creates information into cache memory to accelarate future runs. The first time it'll take a bit more time, thank you for your patience 😏

The execution of this scenario looks like this:

>In this video you see that you are able to switch views between different actors of the scenario by selecting them.
>You can also switch the camera angle on the top right corner, as well as choose to be focused on the selected actor or not.
>Keep in mind that this is the `SUPERVIOR` view. In order to see the `VISUAL` view, you need to configure and start the module (check out our tutorial about this: [How to? Configure the visual rendering](../HT_configure_visual/HT_configure_visual.md)).
>On the bottom right corner of SCANeR, you have some informations about the vehicule you have currently selected.

## Step 3. Stop the simulation
Click on the `Stop Simulation` button (black square in a red circle)

⚠ This is the right way to stop the simulation, any others button should not be used to stop the simulation. ⚠  
Pause the simulation is also possible, click on the `Pause Simulation` button while while the simulation is running 😊

## Step 4. Stop modules
Click on the `Stop Simulator` button (white cross in a red circle)  
![](./assets/StopModules.png)

This button close, and kill the SCANeR modules in a clean way. If you stop the simulation with this button inconsistencies can appear (e.g. at the reload of the next simulation).  

> Tips, you do not have to Stop modules between 2 simulations. If you are looking to run another simulation just after that one keep the modules alive and simply click on `Play Scenario` again. Repeat it as many time you need.

We rely on you to run your simulation as it should be 😉
