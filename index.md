## SCANeR Samples Pack

The Samples-Pack contains about 30 ready-to-use SCANeR configurations. Created by our engineers it is a great source of inspiration and an opportunity to study best practices. Avoid the anxiety of a blank page and use these examples as starting points for your own projects.
If you would like to see new demonstrations added to the Samples-Pack please contact us or open a request on [GitHub page](https://github.com/AVSimulation/SCANeR-Samples-Pack/issues). We may have some scenarios that we can share, or we may take your comments into account in the next revision of the SCANeR Samples-Pack

### Get ready

* [Download and install the Samples Pack](./Pages/HT_InstallSamplesPack/HT_InstallSamplesPack.md)

### Get started

* [ADAS test and validation: create your test case to validate your ADAS](./Pages/HT_ADAS/HT_ADAS.md)
